/** This class shows a possible implementation of a Router. This could be used in a web frontend (using Scala.js) for
  * displaying the correct component, or in a web server for triggering the action corresponding to the calling route.
  *
  * All abstract models are actually instances of [[urldsl.language.UrlPart]], which easily allows to abstract away the
  * concrete choice the user could make as to how they want to match the URL. In this case, we will simply return a
  * value based on what was extracted from the route. This value will be an instance of the
  * [[urldsl.examples.RouterUseCaseExample#Output]], so that we can easily test that the correct route was called.
  *
  * We use the [[urldsl.errors.DummyError]] implementations since we really want to route correctly, we don't care about
  * why a particular url was not matched.
